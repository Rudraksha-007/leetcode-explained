### Tutorial

After enabling the extension, each question will automatically have the [top 5 solution videos](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/solutions/) and [top 5 companies](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/). If you pin the extension in the toolbar & login into ChatGPT in your browser, you can use the following 2 GPT buttons:

- Get your code complexity using ChatGPT
- Fix bugs in your code and return the optimal solution

Please ensure your Leetcode solution is open so the extension can read your code from the page.
